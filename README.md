sRNN <br>
The is updataed version of my neural network from scratch. I have added RNN layer<br>
and made few changes in how optimizers.<br>
Note: Because of exploding/vanishing gradient problems, rnn faces difficulty in <br>
converging. Try adjusting learning rate, number of epoch may work. Otherwise switch<br> 
to LSTM.
